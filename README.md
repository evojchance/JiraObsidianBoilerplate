Yo, let's get you setup really quick.

1) [Download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)
2) Clone repo somewhere
3) Open obsidian
4) Select "Open folder as vault"
5) Select the folder you just cloned.
6) Click "Trust author and enable plugins" (you trust me, right?)
7) In Obsidian, navigate to `README (in Obsidian)` from the file browser on the right (after closing the plugins screen)

Yeehaw, read that file in Obsidian for the setup, cool features, and explanation. Hope this can all be useful, it sure is to me!
